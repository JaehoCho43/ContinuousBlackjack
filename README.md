# Continuous Blackjack

In this notebook, the continuous blackjack game, which was introduced in *G-Research Virtual Quant Finance Algorithmic Challenge (Japan, Online)* will be discussed. This is a partial summary of  [Mu Zhao's note](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10315) who completed the math Ph.D. in Stony Brook University with me and attended this challenge together as a team. I wrote this note for myself to achieve the concrete understanding on this problem with the practice on programming.

More details are included in a notebook file.
